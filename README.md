# cafe-mini-project
The client is a pop up cafe selling various products requiring a software application in order to manage their products, couriers and incoming orders.

This python application will allow the client to display, add, update and delete their products, couriers and incoming orders. The data is saved in CSV files.

There is future room to expand this project to be linked to a database as our client expands their business as well as adding additional functionality to add stock levels to their products and assert that their is enough product stock for incoming orders etc.
