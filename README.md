# cafe-mini-project
The client is a pop up cafe selling various products requiring a software application in order to manage their products, couriers and incoming orders.

This python application will allow the client to display, add, update and delete their products, couriers and incoming orders. The data is saved in CSV files.
Testing (in particular unit testing) and data validation was employed to guarantee the client requirements

With more time, there is future room to expand this project to be linked to a database as our client expands their business as well as adding additional functionality to add stock levels to their products and assert that their is enough product stock for incoming orders, as well as checking the availability of couriers etc. 
One would guarantee these new client requirements via more testing, in particular integration testing (with the database) as well as data validation checks such as the aforementioned with regards to stock levels.
